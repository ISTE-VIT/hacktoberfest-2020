## Queue Data Structure
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. 
The order is First In First Out (FIFO). 
A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. 

## Basic Operations of Queue

A queue is an object or more specifically an abstract data structure(ADT) that allows the following operations:
>  Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue
>  Dequeue: Remove an element from the front of the queue
>  IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
>  IsFull: Check if the queue is full
>  Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it
