 - Centroids of a tree - A vertex is a centroid of a tree only when you cut this vertex (remove it and remove all edges from this vertex), the size of the largest connected component of the remaining graph is the smallest possible. In other words, Centroid of a Tree is a node which if removed from the tree would split it into a 'forest', such that any tree in the forest would have at most half the number of vertices in the original tree.
