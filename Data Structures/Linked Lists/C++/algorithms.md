## Linked List

> This is a linked list algorithm.
A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.
Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

> Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

> Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

> LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

## Types of Linked List
## This is only a Simple Linked List


## Basic Operations

Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

> Insertion − Adds an element at the beginning of the list.
> Deletion − Deletes an element at the beginning of the list.
> Display − Displays the complete list.
> Search − Searches an element using the given key.
